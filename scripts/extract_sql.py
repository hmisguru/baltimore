"""Re-extract the KPI queries from the baltimore repo's System Performance dashboard.

The SQL in sql/ is a copy of specific widgets in balspm.yml (hmisguru/baltimore,
`staging` branch), so the published KPIs match the dashboard exactly. When a
measure's logic changes there, re-run this against a fresh copy of that file:

    git -C ../baltimore show origin/staging:balspm.yml > /tmp/balspm.yml
    python scripts/extract_sql.py /tmp/balspm.yml

The dashboard's `{{ filters.report_start }}` date becomes the BigQuery query
parameter `@report_start`, which the data loader sets to the fiscal year being
reported. Its Project filter (by ProjectName) becomes
`(@all_projects OR p.ProjectID IN UNNEST(@project_ids))`, so one query serves
both the CoC-wide KPIs (`@all_projects = TRUE`) and the "MOHS-funded only"
variant (the loader passes that project list).

One intentional deviation from the dashboard, listed in UNFILTERED_CTES: when
Measure 5.1 is filtered to some projects, the dashboard also narrows its
search for prior homeless-system activity to those same projects, so someone
with a stay elsewhere in the CoC would count as "first-time". The KPIs always
search the whole CoC for prior activity, the same way the dashboard's own
Measure 2 always searches CoC-wide for returns.
